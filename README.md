# Kosmo Unity SDK 

## Setup

Replace your camera by one of the KosmoRoomWithCameraRig prefab.

In the prefab, you can enable the room to validate the outputs with the Kosmo room test patterns.

## Spout

The Kosmo camera rig create a Spout sender for each camera. You can check there outputs by receiving the Spout texture in another application such as the demo SpoutReceiver from the [Spout library](https://spout.zeal.co/).
